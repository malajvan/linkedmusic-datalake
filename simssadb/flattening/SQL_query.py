# steps:
#   1. upload the simssadb dump to a local postgreSQL database called 'simssadb'.
#   2. change db_params fields below as needed.
#   3. Run the scripts, generate the flattened.csv file.
#   Each row associates with a different file_id. File-to-work flattening happens after this, in the script restructure.py (with pandas)
#   flattened.csv however has all the associated features of each file flattened.
#   4. Reconcile the generated flattened.csv and run the script with restructure.py

# Query main info from the database
