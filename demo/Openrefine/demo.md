# OpenRefine demo
## File
Using a small subset of the simssadb file

## Reconciliation demo
- Create a project, for composer and file_format create an identical column with @id and reconcile with wikidata

- Export, remember to set column as wikidata ids (Custom tabular).
- Save the export template

## Re-reconciliation demo
- Upload the updated version of simssadb (needs to create this, somehow making it obvious? Maybe divide the initial database into 2)
- Apply the operation with the history json
- Export using the template json
